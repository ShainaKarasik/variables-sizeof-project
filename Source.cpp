	std::cout << "The byte size of the variable char is  " << sizeof(long long) << std::endl;
	std::cout << "The byte size of the variable char is  " << sizeof(double) << std::endl;
	//note we did not do short or strings? 	std::cout << "The byte size of the variable char is  " << sizeof(char) << std::endl;
	//nor did we do float type strings
	//i want to create a list of ALL variable types in C++ and maybe actually be motivate to create C++ app with all types and all concetps
	//explained in a easy way from beg to advanced with projects in between for games, game engines, software, ceoncept design for game making software,
